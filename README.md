
The industrial sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing a significant
transformation, particularly in terms of safety, environmental sustainability, and
alignment with Vision 2030 goals. With the nation’s commitment to reducing
harmful emissions and enhancing industrial efficiency, there is an urgent need for
advanced systems capable of detecting both gas and smoke leakage. Traditional
methods often allow dangerous accumulations of gas or smoke to go undetected,
posing significant risks to factory workers, the environment, and operational efficiency. In this project, we successfully designed and implemented an innovative
detection system KASHEF, which integrates thermal imaging technology with
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This advanced system enables real-time monitoring and rapid identification of both gas and smoke leaks,
providing timely alerts to expedite maintenance processes and significantly improve workplace safety. By addressing these critical issues, KASHEF helps factories reduce emissions, align with environmental standards, and contribute to the
Kingdom’s sustainability goals.KASHEF captures thermal data and processes it
using AI algorithms to provide precise, instant alerts on potential leaks. The
system’s ability to support rapid response minimizes environmental impact and
ensures operational continuity. Developed using the waterfall methodology, the
project followed a structured approach through its six phases, utilizing tools and
programming languages like Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to achieve robust functionality and seamless integration.With KASHEF fully developed and
rigorously tested, it represents a transformative solution for enhancing industrial
safety and accelerating maintenance efforts in factories. The project not only
addresses gas and smoke safety but also contributes to reducing industrial emissions, preserving the environment, and supporting the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 for
a safer, more sustainable future.
